## Creating and Editing Pages

Follow these steps to create your first documentation page.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Page" icon="plus">
    Navigate to your project dashboard. Click the `New Page` button and select `MDX Document`.

    Choose a file name like `quickstart.mdx`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Frontmatter" icon="settings">
    Every page requires YAML frontmatter at the top:

````mdx
```yaml
---
title: Quickstart Guide
description: Get started with haha in minutes.
---
```
````
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write Content" icon="edit-3">
    Use H2 headings for sections and add components like `<Callout>` for emphasis.

    Preview changes in real-time using the built-in editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish" icon="upload">
    Save and publish. Your page appears in the sidebar navigation automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Organizing Content Structure

Organize pages into folders for better scalability.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Folder Structure" icon="folder">
    Use nested folders like `docs/guides/` and `docs/api/`.

    Example tree:

    ```
    docs/
    ├── quickstart.mdx
    ├── guides/
    │   └── advanced.mdx
    └── api/
        └── endpoints.mdx
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="Navigation Rules" icon="menu">
    Pages inherit parent folder names in the sidebar. Rename folders to update slugs.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Expandable title="Advanced Organization Tips" default-open="false">

- Limit top-level folders to 5-7 for usability.
- Use index.mdx as landing pages for sections.

</Expandable>

## Using Templates and Sections

Templates speed up page creation with pre-built components.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic Template" icon="file-text">
    Copy this starter:

````mdx
```mdx
---
title: New Page
description: Page description.
---

## Overview

Your content starts here.
```
````
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API Template" icon="code">
    For endpoints, include `<Request>` and `<Response>`:

````jsx
```jsx
<Request tabs="JavaScript,cURL">
  ```javascript
  const res = await fetch('https://api.haha.com/v1/users');
  ```
  ```bash
  curl https://api.haha.com/v1/users
  ```
</Request>
```
````
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
